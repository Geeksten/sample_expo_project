### Sample project to figure out how to use expo
Docs found here: https://expo.io/learn

1. Try the snack on the website
2. Download NodeJS if you do not have it already
3. Get the command line tool
   You will run this tool locally to package, serve, and publish your projects.
   
   `npm install expo-cli --global` might need to run this as sudo `sudo npm install expo-cli --global`
4. Create your first project

   You will be asked to create an Expo account  https://expo.io before proceeding.

   ```
   expo init my-new-project
   cd my-new-project
   expo start
   ```
