### Sample project to figure out how to use expo
Docs found here: https://expo.io/learn

1. Try the snack on the website
2. Download NodeJS if you do not have it already
3. Get the command line tool

   You will run this tool locally to package, serve, and publish your projects.
   
   `npm install expo-cli --global` might need to run this as sudo `sudo npm install expo-cli --global`
4. Create your first project

   You will be asked to create an Expo account  https://expo.io before proceeding.

   ```
   expo init my-new-project
   cd my-new-project
   expo start
   ```
5. Preview your project

   Worked with the settin on LAN
   Open Expo Client on your device. Use it to scan the QR code printed by expo start. You may have to wait a minute while your project bundles and loads for the first time.
6. Start coding!

   Select your favorite editor, like Atom, VSCode, Sublime Text, Vim, or Emacs, open your-project/App.js, and start building! We recommend following the [Up and Running](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/up-and-running) tutorial.
